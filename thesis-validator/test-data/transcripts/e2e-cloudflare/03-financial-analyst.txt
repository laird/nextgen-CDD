Expert Call Transcript - Cloudflare Financial Analysis
Date: December 15, 2024
Interviewee: Test Chen, Equity Research Analyst at Test Capital Markets

Interviewer: Thanks for joining us today, Test. We're conducting due diligence on Cloudflare and would value your perspective on their financial trajectory.

Test: Happy to help. I've been covering Cloudflare since their IPO and maintain a Buy rating with a $95 price target. The fundamentals remain compelling despite recent market volatility.

Interviewer: Can you walk us through their recent financial performance?

Test: Certainly. Q3 2024 showed revenue growth of 32% year-over-year to $430 million, which is impressive given their scale. What's particularly noteworthy is their dollar-based net retention rate holding steady at 115%, indicating strong customer expansion despite macro headwinds. Free cash flow margins expanded to 26%, up from 22% last year, demonstrating operational leverage.

Interviewer: How do you view their competitive positioning against the hyperscalers?

Test: This is where Cloudflare's network effects really shine. Their global footprint of 275+ data centers creates a structural advantage - every new location improves performance for all customers. When I compare latency metrics, Cloudflare consistently outperforms AWS CloudFront by 15-20% in most regions. That said, AWS's pricing pressure is real. We're seeing 5-10% annual price declines in basic CDN services.

Interviewer: What about their Zero Trust transition?

Test: This is the key growth driver. Zero Trust revenue is growing 45%+ annually and now represents about 25% of total revenue. Average contract values for Zero Trust customers are 3-4x higher than traditional CDN-only customers. I'm tracking enterprise wins like Shopify and Canva, where Cloudflare displaced legacy vendors with 40-60% cost savings while improving performance.

Interviewer: Any concerns on the risk side?

Test: Two main areas worry me. First, customer concentration - their top 10 customers represent roughly 15% of revenue, creating some dependency risk. Second, the competitive landscape is intensifying. Microsoft's recent Entra integration poses a threat to Zero Trust growth, and Google's edge computing investments are substantial. I'm also watching their R&D spending, which hit 23% of revenue last quarter - necessary but pressuring near-term margins.

Interviewer: How do you think about valuation at current levels?

Test: Trading at roughly 12x forward revenue, Cloudflare appears reasonably valued given their 30%+ growth profile and expanding margins. My DCF model assumes revenue growth moderating to 25% by 2026, which seems conservative given the $200 billion TAM expansion. The key variable is whether they can maintain pricing power as competition intensifies. If they execute on the developer platform vision, I see upside to current multiples.

Interviewer: Final thoughts on the investment case?

Test: Cloudflare sits at the intersection of multiple secular trends - cybersecurity, edge computing, and digital transformation. Their infrastructure moat is real and widening. The risk-reward at current levels favors long-term investors, though near-term volatility is likely given competitive pressures and macro uncertainty.
